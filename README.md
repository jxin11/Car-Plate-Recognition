# Car-Plate-Recognition

The objective of a vehicle license plate recognition system is to identify the exact location of 
the license plate from an image with different quality and complex background and recognize 
the vehicle registration number accurately and effectively. To develop a vehicle license plate 
recognition system, different problems that would affect the accuracy of the system have been 
studied. The proposed algorithm consists of three stages which are License Plate Localization 
& Segmentation with the use of colour-based and shape-based segmentation, Character 
Segmentation and Character Recognition with AlexNet CNN model and Tesseract-OCR 
engine. The proposed algorithm has achieved 70% accuracy and average latency of 1.0438s
with the AlexNet CNN model. This work also shows the effectiveness of different image 
processing techniques in vehicle license plate recognition system and the issues that affect the 
overall performance of the proposed algorithm are also analysed.
